# Project Summary: Financial Data Analysis and Forecasting

This project involved analyzing real-life financial data from the New York Stock Exchange. I utilized a subset of a large dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contained historical financial information from S&P 500 companies. The focus of my analysis was on a smaller subset of this dataset, which I used to complete various tasks within the project.

## Task 1: Revenue Growth Comparison
In this task, I compared the revenue growth between the energy and technology sectors. By analyzing the data, I gained insights into the revenue performance of these sectors and potentially identified any significant differences or trends.

## Task 2: Dynamic Profit and Loss Statement
For this task, I developed a dynamic Profit and Loss (P&L) statement. Using the available historical data, I calculated and displayed the gross profit, operating profit, and EBIT values for each year. The P&L statement provided a comprehensive overview of the financial performance of the selected companies throughout the available years.

## Task 3: Financial Forecasting for QRVO
In this task, I created a financial forecasting model specifically for the company QRVO. Utilizing the information from the dataset, I projected the income for year 4 and year 5. By considering various scenarios, such as the best case, weak case, and base case, I was able to assess the potential financial outcomes for QRVO in the upcoming years.

Throughout the project, I demonstrated my ability to manipulate and analyze financial data, compare sectors, create dynamic reports, and perform financial forecasting. The project allowed me to gain valuable insights into the S&P 500 companies' financial performance and make predictions for future scenarios.
